# SQL DB

#### Research Summary

SQL Database on Azure seems more resource heavy compared to MariaDB and there is a vast difference in the price.

Pricing of the SQL service starts at approximately $500 per month.

Though there are serverless computing options which charge per transaction, these are only limited to SingleDatabase solutions.

Multidatabase solutions are called elastic pools.

Storage can be scaled automatically with elastic pools.

It seems that SQL solutions are tailored for corporate scenarios as a backend for large scale operations.

Backups can be automated and there is a high availability rate.

Pricing can vary widely based on computing power.

An alternative to Azure SQL Database is the SQL Server on Azure VMs which allow a lift and shift option for the BIT DB courses.
