## Studio 5 : 
# Azure VM

#### Research Summary

Azure virtual machines allows users to create machines of various sizes, operating systems and allows relatively wide freedom in terms of networking capabilities.

VMs are easily deployable on Azure Portal and can be connected by ssh through PuTTY, Azure powershell and bash shell.
Access authorisations can be set with a password or pem key.
When a Network security group is added to the VNet, security firewall settings can be configured to restrict access from other sources.

VMs have been used this semester to
* conduct security investigations with Kali Linux.
* establish a MariaDB server
* establish a docker server
* investigate network peering
* explore DevTestLab services
