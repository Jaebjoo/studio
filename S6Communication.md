## Studio 6 : Reflection

# Communication

#### Team Communication

My key connections with team members were with
* Rohill
* Finn

The Storming Phase of the Team was very smooth and I took a more active role in creating a closer relationship with others.
New members to the group include Rohill, Isaac, and Jordan. 

The Team is more well balanced, but it is a concern that Isaac is the only Studio 5 member who will possibly continue with the DevOps team next semester.

**Communication and teamwork is more open and comfortable this semester.**

I have continued communication with Finn to support him in managing the DevOps Team.
