## Studio 5 : Reflection

# Documentation

#### Following Documentation

Following the documentation for User adding on the DB2 and DB3 network highlighted the importance of prooff reading other people's documentation and quality checking the instructions by following it. 
It helped me realise that I needed to make instructions as clear as possible when I am writing it. 
Sometimes it was difficult to follow instructions without screenshots and when various terms were used interchangeably.

Following Documentation on Azure is relatively straight forward with screenshots and instructions and example code.

Reading documentation carefully is one of the most important skills for a Dev Ops engineer. 

#### Writing Documentation

I didn't get a lot of opportunity to do this, but when writing the report for the DB solution I tried to keep the report as concise as possible. It was apparent that superiors do not have a lot of time to read the full document, though it is still important to provide detail if they require it. 

I have started the habit of keeping a portfolio and records of work done.

I need to keep regular records and give a regular update in written form to superiors rather than a simple verbal conversation.

I will write weekly summaries of work done in order to keep the workflow as transparent as possible. 

A Formal Document should be created for each task:

* Task - members - client - deadline - progress report
* Weekly Report - to manager
* D312 Maintenance Records - Need a single file to manage this.
* Meeting Summaries and minutes/transcript should be created and kept on record in a single file.
* Team Management should be managed with a report to Faisal every week so Faisal is able to see who is doing what and on what task.

Need to allocate time to tidying and organising the File system.
