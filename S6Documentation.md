## Studio 6 : Reflection

# Documentation

#### Following Documentation

There has been less following documentation created by other members, but more documentation online about potential solutions.

I have had to follow documentation online about Docker Networking, Puppet and other relevant Azure Services in order to deliver the perfect solution for our clients.

We have also rewritten lab documents which students of Linux and SysAdmin courses will follow.

This has been a great opportunity to contribute to the learning materials at BIT.

#### Writing Documentation
 
Previously in STUDIO 5 I had suggested that 

**A Formal Document should be created for each task:**

* Task - members - client - deadline - progress report
* Weekly Report - to manager
* D312 Maintenance Records - Need a single file to manage this.
* Meeting Summaries and minutes/transcript should be created and kept on record in a single file.
* Team Management should be managed with a report to Faisal every week so Faisal is able to see who is doing what and on what task.

Need to allocate time to tidying and organising the File system.

* **Solution Proposals** have been written to report to Faisal and Rob about each task. 
* **Weekly Report(Email)** to Faisal has given me a chance to reflect on tasks completed during the week and also plan ahead for the following week and ensure that Faisal and I are on the same page in terms of where each task is and where it is heading. It is also an opportunity to proactively report to Faisal about my progress rather than having Faisal follow me up, leaving physical records as words in passing conversatino can be forgotten.
* **D312 Maintenance Records** .... Work in progress..
* **Meeting Summaries** Meeting notes are being made and the Teams Board has been updated accordingly to reflect this.

**It is imperative that documentation is left for future DevOps Team Members to follow.**

We have reorganised the file system so that documentation can be easily archived and also retrieved when necessary.
PC Maintenance records have been updated to a OneNote document so that previous maintenance work can be viewed and compared easily.

Azure Resources OneNote document has also been created to record the individual resources that are being created on Azure. Details are logged about the resource's owner, purpose, IP and other relevant information. 

We have done a better job of documenting Proposals and Reports so that other members are able to see a summary of the jobs being done and completed as well as keeping a record for managers to refer to in the future.
