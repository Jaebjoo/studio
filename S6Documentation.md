## Studio 6 : Reflection

# Documentation

#### Following Documentation

...

#### Writing Documentation
 
Previously in STUDIO 5 I had suggested that 

**A Formal Document should be created for each task:**

* Task - members - client - deadline - progress report
* Weekly Report - to manager
* D312 Maintenance Records - Need a single file to manage this.
* Meeting Summaries and minutes/transcript should be created and kept on record in a single file.
* Team Management should be managed with a report to Faisal every week so Faisal is able to see who is doing what and on what task.

Need to allocate time to tidying and organising the File system.

* **Solution Proposals** have been written to report to Faisal and Rob about each task. 
* **Weekly Report(Email)** to Faisal has given me a chance to reflect on tasks completed during the week and also plan ahead for the following week and ensure that Faisal and I are on the same page in terms of where each task is and where it is heading. It is also an opportunity to proactively report to Faisal about my progress rather than having Faisal follow me up, leaving physical records as words in passing conversatino can be forgotten.
* **D312 Maintenance Records** .... Work in progress..
* **Meeting Summaries** Meeting notes are being made and the Teams Board has been updated accordingly to reflect this.

**It is imperative that documentation is left for future DevOps Team Members to follow.**
