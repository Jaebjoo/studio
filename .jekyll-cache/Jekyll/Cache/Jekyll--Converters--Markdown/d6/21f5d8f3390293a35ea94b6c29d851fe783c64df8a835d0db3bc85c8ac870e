<p>SQL Database on Azure seems more resource heavy compared to MariaDB and there is a vast difference in the price.</p>

<p>Pricing of the SQL service starts at approximately $500 per month.</p>

<p>Though there are serverless computing options which charge per transaction, these are only limited to SingleDatabase solutions.</p>

<p>Multidatabase solutions are called elastic pools.</p>

<p>Storage can be scaled automatically with elastic pools.</p>

<p>It seems that SQL solutions are tailored for corporate scenarios as a backend for large scale operations.</p>

<p>Backups can be automated and there is a high availability rate.</p>

<p>Pricing can vary widely based on computing power.</p>

<p>An alternative to Azure SQL Database is the SQL Server on Azure VMs which allow a lift and shift option for the BIT DB courses.</p>
