A PaaS model can be used to host Websites.
VMs do not need to be individually managed.

This demo shows a WordPress website.

**Although I would not imagine that a Studio Project would require a WordPress Resource, it has become more apparent that it is much easier to create a PaaS than a IaaS. Deployment is more convenient and the development workflow is simplified.**

WordPress App can be found in the Azure Marketplace.
