<h2 id="branching">Branching</h2>
<p>Although this isnâ€™t a particularly complicated technical skill, it was important to coordinate the development process with branches. I made sure with my team mates that we were branching off correctly and merging would be conducted in an appropriate manner. 
I was used to branching in individual assignments. This would usually involve single active branch which would be merged before a new branch. However this project required multiple active branches.
It was a good opportunity for me to experience a development environment with multiple branches being developed simultaneously and solve merge conflicts in following sprints.</p>

<h2 id="environment-set-up">Environment Set up</h2>
<p>As we all had to have our own individual working environment, I had to install several applications onto my computer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GITBASH</li>
  <li>LARAGON</li>
  <li>VISUAL STUDIO CODE</li>
  <li>PHPMYADMIN
Unfortunately, I had always worked on polytechnic computers so just having a development environment was something to learn. My team members explained to me how Laragon worked. I had previous experience using Gitbash and visual studio code and phpmyadmin. It was fairly easy, despite running into problem with phpmyadmin on Laragon.
I am not a person who responds well to using NEW applications. Being exposed to new applications and learning to use them is making me more resilient, versatile, flexible. As a result I am now very comfortable around unfamiliar environments, situations and tools.</li>
