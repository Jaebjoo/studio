## Studio 6 : Reflection

# Professional Development

#### Research

It has been important to do research to find solutions for tasks that needed to be completed.

Examples of Research conducted has been about **Static Web Apps**. In the process of research I have found that I am considering architectural aspects of these resources, such as whether they are a IaaS or a PaaS and weighing the benefits and drawbacks of this.

**I understood that covering the fundamentals of Azure Services, which explain these differences in the hierarchy of Service levels has been valuable in the decision making process.**

The returns of research have become richer as more fundamental knowledge adds deeper analysis of the findings. 
For example, implications of knowing that a PaaS solution exists for hosting a static website opposed to running a VM is huge savings in cost and administration/maintenance of that resource. Deployment/execution of these PaaS solutions is much more straightfoward with fewer steps in between.

**It would be valuable future DevOps Team Members to create "templates", "plans" for possible project scenarios, which outline Azure resources needed, resource architecture, resource configuration, workflows, project management tools for potential projects.**
It is understood that pre-made templates could not be a perfect fit for Studio Projects.
These demo templates could be used by potential projects which will allow the DevOps team to be more integrated in Studio Projects.
A step in this process would also involve communicating with the Studio groups and discussing their projects and considering what the DevOps team could offer, what they could be doing differently with DevOps involvement.

#### Learning

Compared to the previous semester, it has been important not only to continue the learning process on the Azure Cloud Services but to also consider how these resources can be potentially utilised by fellow students in the Studio 5/6. It became more apparent that **simply knowing the possibilities on the cloud services is meaningless without application**. 

For example, although none of the active tasks involved hosting a website, it was valuable to learn that hosting websites was easily possible at a PaaS level, meaning no VMs needed to be created.
This would be valuable for any Studio Teams that are involved in a Web Project. The DevOps team could create a template for WebTeams in the future so that DevOps teams can more actively support other groups and other groups can more actively rely on DevOps to manage their code/developments.

Knowing more about Azure DevOps leads into the possibility of pitching this platform to other groups to manage their projects.
It would be valuable for DevOps team members to conduct "workshops" where these services and platforms can be passed on to other Studio Groups.

I have completed a wide range of Learning Paths on Microsoft Learn, from the Azure Fundamentals, Databases, Remote Computing resources, Webhosting resources and other administrative and security features of Azure. Working close to Rob who is actually doing this as a job and considering operational costs, budgeting, planning and proposals that need to be approved has given me exposure to the realities of DevOps duties.**Knowing the possibilities of each resource has broadened my understanding about the potential of Cloud Services in the future.**
