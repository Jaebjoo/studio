I was able to take the role as Scrum Master during Sprint 3. I coordinated the team's efforts and delegated tasks. I found found solution to the issue of sorting data in tables. I researched the documentation for Kyslik Sortable package and passed this on to my Team Members. I made sure that they understood what was needed to be done and let them code. I reviewed their code and confirmed that it functioned well. I tried to make the development process as stress free as possible for the team. I wanted to avoid a situation where there would be a conflict of opinions on what solution would be better. Instead of 5 people researching for solutions, time was saved by centralising the decision making process under the scrum master. However I did not simply enforce control over the sprint. I would have a working concept and suggested through multiple Zoom calls with members to show how the feature would work and what the coding process would be.

Being Scrum master required myself to be aware of what each member was doing, and able to do for the sprint. I also made sure that I followed up with members to meet certain milestones.
