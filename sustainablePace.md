## SPRINT 4 : AGILE PRINCIPLE
# SUSTAINABLE PACE

There is no doubt that sustainable pace is vital to being AGILE. 
The words "continuous", "frequently" and "sustainable" are mentioned in **Agile Principles 1, 3, 8, 9** and we must work **daily**.

We had failed to sustainably develop in sprint 4. I personally felt that it was harder to come back into the project in sprint 5 after a severe breakdown in workflow. I also felt that simply adding more hours on top of the overload of work would not solve the problem.

It is ironic that development of a project should be viewed as a **marathon** and we need to pace ourselves to develop at a sustainable pace, even though iteration of work is called a **sprint**. It raises the concern in the development world of cramming long hours of work during a **crunch** to meet a deadline.
In hindsight, **aiming for a velocity of 13** during sprint 4 was unsustainable, and impractical and foolish, as we were not willing to view the risk of upcoming deadlines for other assessments. We needed to have better foresight and look at the schedule for weeks ahead. Instead we simply looked at "3 weeks" for a sprint and thought it was enough time. We need to properly calculate **available time** to avoid long hours and the pressure to meet a sprint deadline. I think, once we knew that there wasn't enough time to complete the feature, we lost any willingness to begin the development process and preferred to push the issues back to the backlog and move them back sprint 5. This was NOT Agile, and we this was a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect.
