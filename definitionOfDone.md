# DEFINITION OF DONE

The team had created individual controllers to be able to add, edit delete individual records.
However certain aspects of the feature were not consistent across all types of records.
During the demo to the client, some add records would have a success message and some would not. 
Some records would fail to add.
**This made me consider what the "definition of DONE" actually is.**

This would also be an area of concern for me personally as I created the friendship feature.
The client may have asked for a friendship feature and I had developed it, but it did not allow for blocking or denying. It also did not allow for unfriending. 
Overall, I was satisfied with what I had to be able to say it was DONE. **I believe it is important in future projects to split user stories into different components, so that a huge feature can be developed at a SUSTAINABLE PACE with CONTINOUS DEPLOYMENT without violating the Definition of Done.**

User Stories can only be considered done after meeting the criterias requested by the client.
This emphasises how important client communication is and also trying to satisfy the client. **Agile Principle 1** "Valuable software"
