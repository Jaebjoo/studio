<p>Azure Dev Test Labs provides a more controlled environment for setting up VMs.</p>

<p>VM configurations can be saved as â€œformulasâ€ and replicated at will.</p>

<p>â€œArtifactsâ€ are extensions deployed on VMs.
These can be pre-configured before VMs are deployed.</p>

<p>Resources also have the option to be â€œclaimedâ€ and â€œunclaimedâ€ by users.</p>

<p>Autoshutdown policies can also be set for VMs. This can significantly reduce costs and waste of resources.</p>

<p>It is my personal belief that having preset VM configurations that can be easily created, claimed, unclaimed, shutdown and replicated creates a more dynamic environment where resources are only used On Demand.</p>

<p>These might be more suitable for entities that require a predetermined set of resources for a short term rather than fixing long term VMs.</p>
