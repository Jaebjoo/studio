## Studio 6 : Reflection

# Communication

#### Team Communication

My key connections with team members were with
* Rohill
* Finn

The Storming Phase of the Team was very smooth and I took a more active role in creating a closer relationship with others.
New members to the group include Rohill, Isaac, and Jordan. 

The Team is more well balanced, but it is a concern that Isaac is the only Studio 5 member who will possibly continue with the DevOps team next semester.

**Communication and teamwork is more open and comfortable this semester.**

I have continued communication with Finn to support him in managing the DevOps Team.

The semester has progressed with 4 different sub groups.

1. Finn / Roy
2. Jae / Rohill / Isaac
3. Alister / Jordyn
4. Mason

It has been difficult to work with Mason who is constantly occupied with his personal work and very "passive" about participating in dealing with tickets.
He has not been actively involved in any tickets since the start of the semester. All I know is that he is in charge of "security" and that is it. It is unclear what work he will leave behind for new Studio DevOps Team members interested in security to follow, but I feel it is a significant missed oppportunity.

Alister and Jordyn have distanced themselves from the other groups. Though I believe this is partially due to personality traits, they have been unable to fully communicate their progress to the group. Perhaps Finn could do a better job to follow up with them... but that would be quite unfair to say. I believe that it is every team member's responsibility to keep the team leader informed, not the other way around. They failed to deliver on time, though this is not surprising.

Finn and Roy have been working on the ticketing system which has been completed and online. They have been freed up for the second half of the semester to aid with other tickets as well as documentation of their ticketing system management and set up.

Working with Rohill and Isaac has been enjoyable and we have been able to clear tickets with ease. We have given each other clear timeframes to complete tasks and as the defacto leader of this subgroup, it has been a good opportunity to delegate tasks and manage time and human resources on a macro level to ensure that deadlines are met.

#### Client / Manager Communication

Communication between the Team, Rob and Faisal is crucial.
We have been in situations in the previous semester where Faisal was not fully aware of the situation in the team.

I have tried to report to Faisal , Rob and Finn hours before a Studio class to let them know what I and my team mates will be working on.

I will also relay this message to other team members I am working with.

Rob has been satisfied with the work and team work overall and I have discussed how team chemistry within the team seems to be key.

With slight overlap with Team communication, I feel it would be a good idea to have a peer performance review.
It would be an opportunity for team members to relay their personal thoughts about a team member and monitor team chemistry. 
It is difficult to view the inner workings within the team as a manager. Though I have tried my best to relay this kind of information to Rob as often as possible so that he feels more connected to the team's progress and atmosphere.
