##### What did I do well? 
### CODING + COMMUNICATION
I was able to promptly finish the task that was assigned to me without any potential conflicts. As each team member had a different controller/view to build, none of our work was dependent on each other, we were able to individually develop and then merge together to finish the sprint as a team.
Near the end of the sprint, I was able to coordinate remotely with other team members to merge each branches and also run through a demo together before the client meeting. Coding the resource controllers to implement CRUD for WEIGHTS was done without much difficulty after some assistance from Rohill who was the SCRUM MASTER/ Chief Programmer. And then the code was merged with minor conflicts through clear communication routes.

##### What could I have done better? 
### KANBAN BOARD MANAGEMENT
Better management of the Kanban board. I had made the mistake of adding duplicate items on the board, distinguishing sprint tasks and user stories, however this could have been simply solved by adding tags to user stories that were being worked on. Due to my mistake, the Kanban board was confusing and difficult to follow. I will discuss the kanban board management rules and simplify the issues and tags.

##### What lessons did I learn? 
### REMOTE WORKPLACE
I learnt how to work remotely as a team. It was a good opportunity to use different programs and platforms. I realised how inconvenient it can be to have multiple channels. In the future, if I am part of a team which must work remotely, I feel confident that I will be able to work comfortably in such a workplace set up.

##### What barriers did I encounter? 
### TIME MANAGEMENT + PANDEMIC
Near the end of the sprint, we faced a nationwide lockdown. I had to quickly adapt to the new environment and team organisation. Managing time and staying motivated and focused while at home was quite difficult. I had to rely on myself and the internet if no one else was online. Trying to separate personal, work and study became increasingly difficult as there were weak boundaries, where as we would be physically on campus to stay focused on work. Though this was a challenge, I was able to adapt easily, and get familiar with the new tools such as ZOOM or SLACK.
