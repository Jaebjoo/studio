<p>Azure Virtual Networks are easy to deploy, however considerations on Network Design should be thoroughly planned beforehand.</p>

<p>Creating Virtual Switches using Hyper-V Manager is also possible.</p>

<p>VMs are able to have restricted access from the public network and only gain access through a gateway VM.</p>

<p>Vnets can be interconnected using Peering.
Subnets can also be easily created within Azure.</p>

<p>Different conffigurations are possible with VMs able to attach 2+ Network adaptors. Bridging on a gateway VM was attempted but not completed.</p>

<p>Several Factors need to be considered while Planning virtual networks. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Naming</li>
  <li>Region</li>
  <li>Subscription</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Connectivity</li>
  <li>Permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>Connectivity is limited across several regions, so it is imperative to check that all necessary resources are available and offered by Azure in a particular region before deployment.</p>

<p>Network Security groups can easily limit who has access to resources on a network and permissions can restrict that scope according to a entityâ€™s hierarchy.</p>
