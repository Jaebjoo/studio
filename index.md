### Thank you!

This Portfolio documents 16 weeks developing a website utilising Agile techniques.

Working as a team to meet the needs of a client was exciting and would become invaluable experience for future projects.

There were unforeseen challenges including a Global Pandemic. 

It was difficult at times to balance work, life and study but I was able to grow as a person and a developer.

I hope to get the opportunity to work in a Agile Environment in the future.

Thank You

Sincerely,
