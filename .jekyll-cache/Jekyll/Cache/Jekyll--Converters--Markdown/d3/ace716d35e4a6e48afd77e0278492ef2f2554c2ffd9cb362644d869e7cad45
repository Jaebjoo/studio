<p>Client Requested the on-site teaching resources for DB2 and DB3 classes to be migrated to the Azure Cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Azure solutions are to be researched and possible solutions accounting for features and costs are to be recommended</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The focal point of the solution was the DBaaS vs IaaS
The current configuration of the resources are 2 VMs, one running MariaDB and one running a Docker service with SSMS server.</p>

<p>A simple lift and shift option would require two similar sized VMs to be created on the Azure infrastructure with adequate security configurations and automated tasks.</p>

<p>Research into the DBaaS solution revealed advantages of automated maintenance of the resources traded for the loss of custom scripts being able to be managed on the machines.</p>
