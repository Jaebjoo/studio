## Studio 6 : 
# Labs Rewritten

The labs for the Linux course were rewritten to reflect the changes using docker network.
Rohill had written most of the document and the document was proofread together as we migrated the architecture to Azure.

The labs will require the students to install docker and the required packages.
Create the docker containers and networks
Create the bridge to link the two subsidiary containers
Change the IP addressing and default routes
