##### What did I do well? 
### ASSIST MEETINGS
As the group entered into a period of final assessments in other courses, we had very minimal time for development as well as meetings. I took the initiative to create agendas and rough drafts of schedules so that team members could comment on them on SLACK in their own time before the meetings so that the meetings would run smoothly, on time and conclude with a consensus about sprint tasks and schedules.

##### What could I have done better? 
### DETAILED FINISH ON EXISTING FEATURES
The friendship feature from the previous sprint had been functioning, though it was unpolished, and displayed user IDs rather than names in certain tables. The client would have appreciated if the feature was of a higher quality, however further development time for this feature could not be allocated.

##### What lessons did I learn? 
### AUTOMATED TESTING
I learnt how to write and run Unit Tests. It took longer to write it than to actually physically test the features and functions myself on the website by using it, but I see the value of automated testing on large projects with a wide variety of use cases. Time spent on testing would increase exponentially. Automated testing would simplify the process.

##### What barriers did I encounter? 
### UNDERSTANDING TESTING 
I wasn't sure how to actually write a test and it took me a some time to find resources to understand the actual lines of code I needed to write to test various aspects of the site.
