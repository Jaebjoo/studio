<h4 id="research-summary">Research Summary</h4>

<p>Azure virtual machines allows users to create machines of various sizes, operating systems and allows relatively wide freedom in terms of networking capabilities.</p>

<p>VMs are easily deployable on Azure Portal and can be connected by ssh through PuTTY, Azure powershell and bash shell.
Access authorisations can be set with a password or pem key.
When a Network security group is added to the VNet, security firewall settings can be configured to restrict access from other sources.</p>

<p>VMs have been used this semester to</p>
<ul>
  <li>conduct security investigations with Kali Linux.</li>
  <li>establish a MariaDB server</li>
  <li>establish a docker server</li>
  <li>investigate network peering</li>
  <li>explore DevTestLab services</li>
</ul>
