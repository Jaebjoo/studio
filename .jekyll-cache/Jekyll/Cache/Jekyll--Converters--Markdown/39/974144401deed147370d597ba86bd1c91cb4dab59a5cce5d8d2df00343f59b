<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The Client requested Windows machines to be imaged and cloned/deployed onto blank machines so that they could be donated to those who needed computers in the community.</p>

<p>The team was provided with an imaging/cloning software CloneDeploy to try to come up with a working solution.</p>

<p>Though Hamish had used the software to deploy linux systems, it had not been used to deploy windows machines.</p>

<p>I took somewhat of a support role in this ticket with Reagan and Scott leading. I did not see Alister personally for much of the tasks.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<p>This task has been the only task that has stalled during the semester.</p>

<p>A proper solution was not found.</p>

<p>The team ran into a multitude of problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>patching</li>
  <li>internet connection</li>
  <li>networking</li>
  <li>initiating the imaging process</li>
  <li>bios settings</li>
  <li>initiating the deployment</li>
  <li>patching post-deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel there was not enough research into the task personally, 
I also feel that we were lead into the task with an unsuitable software that was not fully tested.
We were also expected to complete other tasks, it was difficult to fully commit to this task.
Communication within the team was sufficient, however communication with the client had slightly deteriorated.</p>

<p>It has been interesting approaching this task, as it involved actual operating systems and physical hardware as opposed to the virtual systems on Azure.</p>

<p>We will have to report to this task in the following semester.
It was disappointing to have an incomplete ticket.</p>
