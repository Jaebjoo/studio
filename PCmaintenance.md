## Studio 6 : 
# PC Maintenance

#### Client's Requests

* Rob has asked the DevOps Team to regularly maintain the PCs in D312.
* This involves troubleshooting, recording and resolving hardware or software issues.
* Work done needs to be documented for future reference

#### Summary

* PCs in D312 are regularly damaged from classes and components need to be replaced.
* Operating System Software often needs to be updated or reinstalled.

* Several computers have been repaired after inspection during the semester.
* Work has been divided between the DevOps team. Groups of 2 will be responsible for maintenance each Friday.

#### Reflection

* Work is often not done by several members of the team and needs to be followed up on.
* Work be other members are not documented in detailed and reported to Rob.
* Although the work can be time consuming, it is worth noting that Rob's time is more valuable than ours.

#### Worklog

###### March 5th

Though it was not rostered, Rob had asked for volunteers for PC Maintenance.
I presume it was asked of personally as it was the first round of Maintenance and Rob wanted know about the scope of the work to be done.

PC K6 was repaired with a new functioning HD with the operating system.
PC K6 was failing to boot because of thie reason.

PC K10 needed a new motherboard, CPU and HD with operating system installed.
The motherboard had to be fitted into the existing case.

Other PCs were tested and functional, Isaac helped with the other half of the machines.

K10 was rewired, but still requires the HD to be fitted into the case.
Upon power up it was apparent that the HD did not load the Operating system after being moved into the new machine.
It requires reinstal of the OS with the DVDROM.

The K10 Machine will require further work in Week3 before it is available for use.
