<p>Following the documentation for User adding on the DB2 and DB3 network highlighted the importance of prooff reading other peopleâ€™s documentation and quality checking the instructions by following it. 
It helped me realise that I needed to make instructions as clear as possible when I am writing it. 
Sometimes it was difficult to follow instructions without screenshots and when various terms were used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Following Documentation on Azure is relatively straight forward with screenshots and instructions and example code.</p>
