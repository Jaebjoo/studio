<p>It is apparent now that self-directed research is key in the industry.
I have been mislead by my own naivety that professionals in this field know everything there is. I saw that Rob, the IT manager at BIT researching and searching for solutions in parallel to our own research into DB on Azure.</p>

<p>Research is an integral part of being an IT Expert, the need for this is clearer than ever and I am more motivated to learn. I realise that there is much more that I do not know with a bachelors degree but also know that 2 years at BIT has given me the foundation to leap into the wider field of IT knowledge.</p>

<p>Research into the Database solutions, Iaas and DBaas/PaaS options was a great experience. This allowed me to utilise actual knowledge to a real life problem.</p>
