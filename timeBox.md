Time boxing is an agile technique where "Rather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached, and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished." - agile alliance.

As I was developing the Friendship feature, I would use **30 minute time boxes** to stop and and reevaluate what work has been done and what needs to be done. The feature was also broken up into smaller components that were more manageable. I would use the breaks in between to assess whether I needed to ask my other team members for help and use **pair programming**. Time boxing was an effective tool to increase productivity, and avoid trying to develop too much at once. 

During previous sprints I would often add a time limit on certain tasks allocated to a team such as RESEARCH or WRITING USER STORIES. I would set the TIMER on my watch for 10 minutes and tell team members to come back together and share what we had. In hindsight, this was use of TIME BOXING without being aware of the agile technique.

Although I did not explicitly mention timeboxing to my team members, I tried to limit the loss of time at the end of meetings as they had a tendency to drag on. I tried to limit meetings to 15 - 30 minutes and restrict the sharing of knowledge to a "need to know basis". Once general meeting agendas were delivered, a meeting should be disbanded and individual channels of communication used for information specific to a particular member.

During Sprint 5 we needed to maximise the use of the limited amount of time we had, and time boxing was a very effective tool.
