## Studio 5 : 
# Imaging, Cloning

#### Client's Requests

![Client Request](images\Imaging_Cloning\1ClientRequest.png "Client Request")

#### Summary

The Client requested Windows machines to be imaged and cloned/deployed onto blank machines so that they could be donated to those who needed computers in the community.

The team was provided with an imaging/cloning software CloneDeploy to try to come up with a working solution.

Though Hamish had used the software to deploy linux systems, it had not been used to deploy windows machines.

I took somewhat of a support role in this ticket with Reagan and Scott leading. I did not see Alister personally for much of the tasks. 

#### Reflection

This task has been the only task that has stalled during the semester. 

The team ran into a multitude of problems

* patching
* internet connection
* networking
* initiating the imaging process
* bios settings
* initiating the deployment
* patching post-deployment
