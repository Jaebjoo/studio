Defining User Stories, we were able to record CUSTOMER COLLABORATION into functional requirements which the team could develop into features. With the ATOMIC nature of user stories, organising tasks in such a manner allowed INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT. This in conjunction with CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT not only increased the return on investment after each SPRINT, we were able to receive continuous FEEDBACK from our client after each SPRINT. This cycle minimised LEAD TIME, which is the time elapsed between when a client requests a function and when this feature is delivered to the user.
