##### What did I do well? 
### DEVELOPING UNFAMILIAR FEATURE
This feature was totally new for me. Other aspects of this project I had learnt before in other courses. I was able to develop a feature and implement the solution just by reading documentation on the internet.
I was able to increase productivity with agile techniques such as time boxing and pair programming.

##### What could I have done better? 
### MORE CLIENT COMMUNICATION
Prototypes, wireframes, mock ups so the client could see and feel what was being built. The client could have wanted the button to be at a particular spot, in a particular colour, and the friendships displayed in a particular manner and particular success messages when friends are added and accepted. In the future, it would be ideal to have an iterative process with clients in the design of the feature so that the client has more input in the development process.

##### What lessons did I learn? 
### TIME BOXING + PAIR PROGRAMMING
I learnt how to create a friendship system on a website, but most of all I learnt how to use TIME BOXING and PAIR PROGRAMMING in the development process which maximised productivity. I would apply these concepts in future projects to increase output and shorten the development time as well as increasing teamwork. This was much more effective than trying to tackle a huge problem on my own. I could break up a big problem into small sections that I would tackle in an iterative process and then have other "navigators" join in and work together to solve difficult issues.

##### What barriers did I encounter? 
### UNDERSTANDING DOCUMENTATION
Understanding the documentation was difficult. Although it was empowering after the feature was functioning, the development process was often agonising. Although I was able to push through these challenges using time boxing and pair programming, it was a good experience to develop something unfamiliar. I presume this would be common in the real world where there wouldn't be a lecturer teaching you how to develop something. You would take directions from a scrum master and discuss solutions.
