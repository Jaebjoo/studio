<h5 id="what-did-i-do-well">What did I do well?</h5>
<h3 id="leadership">LEADERSHIP</h3>
<p>This sprint was an opportunity for me to lead the team, both as an administrator and technical role. It was crucial for me to increase the level of communication between myself and other members not only to monitor progress but also to train members to be able to code the solution. I was satisfied with the opportunity to develop my leadership.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="what-could-i-have-done-better">What could I have done better?</h5>
<h3 id="time-management--task-delegation">TIME MANAGEMENT + TASK DELEGATION</h3>
<p>Time management could be improved to remain as productive as possible. Trying to keep regular hours that coincide with other members was difficult, but being able to work collectively as a group would ensure that we are able to remain as productive as we can be. Though it was effective, being a HUB for communication and almost micromanaging other members was time consuming, and I believe it would be better for me to allocate tasks more in the future.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="what-lessons-did-i-learn">What lessons did I learn?</h5>
<h3 id="surgical-team--team-structuring">SURGICAL TEAM + TEAM STRUCTURING</h3>
<p>It was much easier to progress through the development by having a leader. This streamlined the decision making process as well as the workflow for the other members. Members did not have to spend too much time storming and deciding what to do and who would do it and how much it would be. This streamlined administrative process could be used in the future to increase productivity.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="what-barriers-did-i-encounter">What barriers did I encounter?</h5>
<h3 id="time--schedule-constraints">TIME / SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS</h3>
<p>Time constraints were a concern. What I realised was that time was the most valuable resource. There was only a fixed amount of time we could spend and I tried to simplify information that needed to be shared and what everyone needed to be aware of. Also having a fixed time when we can all be working on the same thing at the same time was difficult to manage. Though I was able to find a way around this by having daily meetings with individual members to keep them up to date, this often involved me repeating the same information again. Face to face conversations with individual members rather than posting a memo for all to see was still better.</p>
