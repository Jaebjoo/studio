An HTTP request is a common operation on most platforms and devices. Whether it's a request to look up a word in a dictionary or to get the local weather, we send HTTP requests all the time. Azure Functions allows us to quickly create a piece of logic to execute when an HTTP request is received.

An HTTP trigger is a trigger that executes a function when it receives an HTTP request. HTTP triggers have many capabilities and customizations, including:

* Provide authorized access by supplying keys.
* Restrict which HTTP verbs are supported.
* Return data back to the caller.
* Receive data through query string parameters or through the request body.
* Support URL route templates to modify the function URL.
* When you create an HTTP trigger, select a programming language, provide a trigger name, and select an Authorization level.

You must create a function app.
