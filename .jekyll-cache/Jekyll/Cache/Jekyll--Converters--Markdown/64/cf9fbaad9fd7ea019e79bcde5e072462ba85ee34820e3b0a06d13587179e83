<h4 id="research-summary">Research Summary</h4>

<p>Azure IoT allows creation and management of IoT devices using IoT Central and IoT Hub.</p>

<p>A Dashboard view on Azure Portal allows users to view telemetry data that is sent from IoT devices and analyse them with Stream Analysis services. Futher Demonstration of IoT possibilities are explored in IoT Simulations page.</p>

<p>Devices are configured with different hardware options and also able to hold customised IoT Apps.</p>

<p>For this semester, code examples were used to create dummy telemetry data to simulate devices.</p>

<p>The advantage of Azure IoT is that it can be integrated with Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics.</p>

<p>IoT connections themselves, creation and management of the devices owned by the entity do not have a cost attached.</p>

<p>Azure would be charging for the storage and processing of data using their other services and full integration with resources such as Databases and Networks of VMs on Azure Platform.</p>
