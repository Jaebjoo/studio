## Studio 6 : 
# Create Windows VM

#### Azure Learn

Azure virtual machines (VMs) enable you to create dedicated compute resources in minutes that can be used just like a physical desktop or server machine.

**You can connect to these resources using Remote Desktop.**

This is an alternative to creating a Linux based machine. 

It is difficult to consider potential applications of this resource in Studio as most server machines are Linux based to host Web Projects and hold Databases.

**These resoures may become key in the future OP architecture when all devices are BYOB and virtual windows machines are allocated to each student after enrolment.**

Windows Server can be found in the marketplace.

**These are the demo configurations for this example windows VM.**

**This VM costs $90~ per month.**

**Disk sizes can also be configured.**

**Networking can be configured to be part of a particular subnet.**

**Subnets in an organisation maybe divided according to divisions, departments or teams.**

**After the VM has been created, an RDP file can be downloaded from the "connect" section of settings.**

**You need Microsoft Remote Desktop to use this RDP file.**

**This is the interface of the Remote Desktop Application.**

**The username/ip and password from the overview page of the VM resource needs to be entered.**

**This will give you access to the Windows machine in the cloud. It was slightly slower than a physical machine, but easily usable.**

**Server Manager can be used to manage this machine as a server. This will be valuable when the ICT server resources are migrated to Azure.**
