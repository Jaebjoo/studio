## Studio 5 : Reflection

# Communication

#### Team Communication

I believe team communication is an area that could be improved greatly in the next semester. 

My key connections with team members were with
* Bex
* Finn
* Scott
* Reagan
* Jonathon

As the entire Dev Ops team was tasked with different tasks, it was difficult to keep in close communication with everyone. I am unsure if a dynamically organising team is a good fit. In terms of organisation, I sometimes felt that I was being pulled from one team to another as well as juggling my own tasks. It made me think about the **surgical team** organisation with a seperate teams that were organised with different roles. It might be better to split the entire dev ops team into 2 different teams with current Studio 5 members as Scrum Leaders of the sub groups and other memebrs assisting. 

The communication between team members on Teams was okay. 
I feel there needs to be a agreed rule about when team members can send messages during the weekends, or a working time for the weekend should be agreed upon before hand. 
I feel regular stand-up meetings need to be carried out frequently with team members to make sure they feel a close connection.

I will do better to communicate with Finn as a fellow Studio 6 member next semester as well as welcoming Studio 5 members.

#### Client Communication

Communications with the client was kept concise and kept to a minimum.
Meetings were well prepared and communication and inquiries with the client were clear.

Communication with Rob however needs to be better prepared. 
I will be conducting this with more confidence and preparation in the next semester.

#### Manager Communication

Communication with Faisal needs to improve, perhaps regular weekly reports would be good, treating this as if it is a actual job. Mostly, I am lacking confidence while communicating with superiors and this needs to be addressed with better knowledge of the Azure platform and meticulous preparation.
