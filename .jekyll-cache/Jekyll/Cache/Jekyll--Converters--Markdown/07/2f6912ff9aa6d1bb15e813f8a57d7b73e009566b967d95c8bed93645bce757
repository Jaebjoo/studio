<h4 id="team-communication">Team Communication</h4>

<p>I believe team communication is an area that could be improved greatly in the next semester.</p>

<p>My key connections with team members were with</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bex</li>
  <li>Finn</li>
  <li>Scott</li>
  <li>Reagan</li>
  <li>Jonathon</li>
</ul>

<p>As the entire Dev Ops team was tasked with different tasks, it was difficult to keep in close communication with everyone. I am unsure if a dynamically organising team is a good fit. In terms of organisation, I sometimes felt that I was being pulled from one team to another as well as juggling my own tasks. It made me think about the <strong>surgical team</strong> organisation with a seperate teams that were organised with different roles. It might be better to split the entire dev ops team into 2 different teams with current Studio 5 members as Scrum Leaders of the sub groups and other memebrs assisting.</p>

<p>The communication between team members on Teams was okay. 
I feel there needs to be a agreed rule about when team members can send messages during the weekends, or a working time for the weekend should be agreed upon before hand. 
I feel regular stand-up meetings need to be carried out frequently with team members to make sure they feel a close connection.</p>

<p>I will do better to communicate with Finn as a fellow Studio 6 member next semester as well as welcoming Studio 5 members.</p>

<h4 id="client-communication">Client Communication</h4>

<p>Communications with the client was kept concise and kept to a minimum.
Meetings were well prepared and communication and inquiries with the client were clear.</p>

<p>Communication with Rob however needs to be better prepared. 
I will be conducting this with more confidence and preparation in the next semester.</p>

<h4 id="manager-communication">Manager Communication</h4>

<p>Communication with Faisal needs to improve, perhaps regular weekly reports would be good, treating this as if it is a actual job. Mostly, I am lacking confidence while communicating with superiors and this needs to be addressed with better knowledge of the Azure platform and meticulous preparation.</p>
