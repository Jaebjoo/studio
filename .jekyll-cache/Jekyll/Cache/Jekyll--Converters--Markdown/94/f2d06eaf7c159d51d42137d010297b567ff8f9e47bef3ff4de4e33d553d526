<p>Time Management has been the most challenging aspect of this semester.
Even as I am writing this, I have been working a full time job working 40+ hours while studying. It has been an intense semester, the most challenging year of my life with a lot of pressure and a lot at stake.</p>

<p>I need to spend the 2 month break studying Azure documentation and progressing through the courses availble online for Dev Ops.</p>

<p>I need to keep a promise to keep up with Study at the start of the year and be better prepared mentally with expertise to hit the ground running next semester.</p>

<p>The mistake that I had made this semester was wasting too much time trying to figure out what it is I wanted to achieve with the IoT research.</p>

<p>I waited until week 6-7 before I leaped onto a ticket with Bex and Finn.
I should not have waited this long. I will not let new members next semester to wait so long.</p>

<p>1 hour of every week should be allocated to documentation.
It has been extremely difficult to do this as I have pushed this to the last moment to formalise the documentation.
1 hour every week should be allocated to recording what has been completed and what is in progress.</p>

<p>I think the weekly written reports to Faisal should help this.
Time schedule should be kept so that sub teams are able to see who is available when and free to do what.</p>
