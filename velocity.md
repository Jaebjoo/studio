## SPRINT 4 : AGILE PRINCIPLE
# VELOCITY

During Sprint 4 we were introduced to the idea of story points. Each Story point that is achieved is added to the sprint's velocity.

#### Velocity

Sprint 3 : 5

Sprint 4 : 0

SPrint 5 : 13

As we were overloaded with workload from other courses, our development came to an absolute halt and velocity became 0.

Of course we were able to return in sprint 5 and complete all the promised features to reach a velocity of 13, this did not show development at a **sustainable pace** as sprint 4 was 0.

Although we **retroactively** applied story points to sprint 3 tasks, it would have still had a velocity of 5. This is a fair allocation of points as we had completed 3 major features in sprint 5 compared to sprint 3. If we were to continue in future sprints, we would reflect on whether the velocity of 13 would be sustainable or not. We would also reflect on wether the initial assignment of 5 points for each feature was too low or not.

Overall, the concept of velocity was very useful in **sprint planning** and estimating the workload. It was unfortunate that sprint 4 was torpedoed by overwhelming workloads from other courses.
