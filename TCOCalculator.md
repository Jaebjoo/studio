It is possible to compare the cost benefits of Azure Cloud Services by using the TCO calculator. It will create an approximate cost breakdown summary.

In this example, the savings for this organisation is over $700,000 NZD.

It can be easily seen that such costs savings could be made with Otago Polytechnic.

It is my understanding that Capital Expentidure costs are as high as $100,000 NZD for OP. It is clear that most of the savings are to be made through the absence of hardware.

**As BIT is preparing to migrate to the Azure Cloud Services, the BIT department has vast server hardware in on premises, and also VM licensing costs. It also has a significant cost of supplying computers in labs for students to use. It is my understanding that the ultimate plan is to create a BYOD environment, minimising the burden of BIT to sustaining physical machines.**

It is clear that there are huge financial benefits of migrating to the cloud as soon as possible.

In the demo of the TCO calculator, I needed to consider the following mock scenario with this Organisation. It requires 50 * 2 VMs, large storage volumes and several databases.

It is not too different with the requirements of the OP infrastructure.

It is important to identify the resource needs of the organisation when planning the costs.

You must enter the resource needs according to each resource into the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) calculator

The total cost of these resources will be calculated.

This is approximately calculated with on premises costs.
