<h4 id="research-summary">Research Summary</h4>

<p>Azure Dev Test Labs provides a more controlled environment for setting up VMs.</p>

<p>VM configurations can be saved as “formulas” and replicated at will.</p>

<p>“Artifacts” are extensions deployed on VMs.
These can be pre-configured before VMs are deployed.</p>

<p>Resources also have the option to be “claimed” and “unclaimed” by users.</p>

<p>Autoshutdown policies can also be set for VMs. This can significantly reduce costs and waste of resources.</p>
