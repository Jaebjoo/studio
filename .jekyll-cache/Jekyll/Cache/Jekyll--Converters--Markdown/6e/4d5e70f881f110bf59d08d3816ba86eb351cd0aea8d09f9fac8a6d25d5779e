<p>Client Requested the on-site teaching resources for DB2 and DB3 classes to be migrated to the Azure Cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Azure solutions are to be researched and possible solutions accounting for features and costs are to be recommended</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The focal point of the solution was the DBaaS vs IaaS
The current configuration of the resources are 2 VMs, one running MariaDB and one running a Docker service with SSMS server.</p>

<p>A simple lift and shift option would require two similar sized VMs to be created on the Azure infrastructure with adequate security configurations and automated tasks.</p>

<p>Research into the DBaaS solution revealed advantages of automated maintenance of the resources traded for the loss of custom scripts being able to be managed on the machines.</p>

<p>Costs were revealed to be similar for MariaDB solutions, though the SQL Server solution would be significantly different.</p>

<p>As the Microsoft solutions are tailored for corporate solutions which are heavy duty, they are resource heavy and consequently most costly than a single VM solution. Microsoft does not tailor for smaller operations.</p>

<p>Though Serverless single database solutions exist, which are charged on a transaction basis, it cannot handle multiple databases interlinked in a pool.</p>

<p>DB2 - MariaDB (DBaaS) Solution was chosen. A working prototype needs to be set up with users added.</p>

<p>DB3 - SQL Server needs to be created, although the DBaaS solution is being reviewed to determine whether costs are within budget.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<p>Through this task, I have learnt how to create VMs that are running MariaDB.
I have run scripts on these machines to add users.</p>

<p>I have also explored the DBaaS by creating a MariaDB Server.
A method of adding users to this server with a script and csv file is being reviewed.</p>

<p>This task gave me an opportnity to fully explore the Database solutions on Microsoft Azure.</p>
