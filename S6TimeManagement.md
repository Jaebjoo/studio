#### Work - Life - Study Balance

Keeping a healty balance between work, life and study has always been the most challenging aspect of my time at BIT.

I have tried to stay ahead of deadlines as much as possible in anticipation of unforseen challenges and issues.
We have generally met deadlines without the need to ask for extensions. We have also tried to avoid over promising on deliverables.

Work has been generally manageable during this semester, however personally it will always be the first priority in my life.
Luckily I have not had to drop study and work on a DevOps Team task in order to do work. I am fortunate that I have had good teammates to work together on a ticket and share the work load. It is always good to have a second opinion and someone to discuss problems with.

Personal life has often been slightly sacrificed. For example, coming in during the semester break to do PC maintenance and decommissioning ticket. 
I am just glad that tickets are being closed without significant delays and they are out of the way.
The team can focus on their own allocated tasks without other distractions.

I have tried to keep my portfolio as up to date as possible in order to avoid a "crunch" at the end of the semester when we need to write everyting up.

I have good confidence that I will be able to deliver what has been promised to a high standard.

I am grateful for the opporunity to have taken part in this Studio team to experience working with others to create IT solutions for clients.
