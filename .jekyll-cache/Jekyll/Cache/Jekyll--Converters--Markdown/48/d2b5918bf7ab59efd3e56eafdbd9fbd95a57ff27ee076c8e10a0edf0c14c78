<p>Need further research into PowerShell in the future…</p>

<p>This research is incomplete..</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems that access to all resources on Azure can be done through Windows Powershell which can be installed onto the Desktop, on almost all operating systems.
There is no need to use PuTTY.</p>

<p>Need to explore use of PowerShell to run scripts to add and manage users on particular resources….</p>
