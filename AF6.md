# Azure Fundamentals 6 - Pricing

#### Azure Research

Azure provides pricing tools for Cloud Administrators to evaluate the financial costs of the Resources, these tools can be used to assist budgeting and also to produce a cost-benfit analysis.

Many organisations would need to take these considerations before migrating their resources to the Cloud. However as Azure resources benefit from flexible scaling and elasticity as well as economies of scale, the cost savings to many organisations will have great financial appeal.

I have experienced this first hand in the OP migration process as we discuss costs of resources as we evaluate the feasibility of solutions. Rob as the Cloud Administrator for BIT will have to make sound financia decisions.
