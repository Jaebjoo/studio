<h4 id="clients-requests">Clientâ€™s Requests</h4>

<p>Client requests drills to be conducted on the DB2 and DB3 VMâ€™s to add users and create docker containers for each user.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Following documentation and updating it as the team was a challenge. Though it created good communication between the team to cross check how the procedures were meant to be carried out.
DB2 Users were created using a script with a csv file of student details.
DB3 Users were also created in the same manner with the addition of docker container creations.</p>

<p>Full functionality was confirmed after procedures were carried out.
The Machines were reverted back to a restore point for other members to carry out the exercise.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It was a good opporunity to be exposed to scripting and automating tasks such as user adding and container creation</li>
  <li>It was also a good experience to work together as a team to update documentation and manuals to carry out procedures.</li>
  <li>As each team member followed the documentation, it was a check to see whether the procedures written were clear and concise enough for others to follow.</li>
  <li>This gave a clear insight into the importance of documenting CLEAR instructions with detailed evidence.</li>
</ul>
