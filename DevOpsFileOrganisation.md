## Studio 6 : 
# DevOps Files Organisation

#### Summary

The DevOps Team Files were disorganised and unused documents and files needed to be cleaned up. 

An organised storage of documentation is important to share information within the group. It is important to also keep the documentation as up to date as possible and relevant.

#### Reflection

My personal experience of the files in the DevOps team has been largely negative with most of the files in the disorganised and some in the root directory. There must be some rules and agreement within the group as to where particular files and information must be placed. 

Any irrelevant information that is no longer referred to must be removed.

Keeping this documentation up to date is important as the Studio Team experiences a member turnover every 6 months with graduates leaving and new Studio 5 students entering.

**PC Maintenance One Note log has a table on each page. There are Section tabs with a tasks page detailing the task to be conducted.**

**Each log page is to document that status of each machine. Organising this log in a One Note document with individual pages able to be accessed on one document allows the team to track the history of a particular device.**

**The Azure Resource List One Note will be a document to record individual resource group and resource details on the Azure infrastructure. Future members will be able to refer to the document to gain information about particular resources. This also ensures that information is carried over from one semester to another.**

**The Proposals Documents. These are documents proposing a solution for a problem requesting required resources for a solution for Rob and Faisal to approve before any tasks continue.**
