<p>Azure Virtual Networks are easy to deploy, however considerations on Network Design should be thoroughly planned beforehand.</p>

<p>Creating Virtual Switches using Hyper-V Manager is also possible.</p>

<p>VMs are able to have restricted access from the public network and only gain access through a gateway VM.</p>

<p>Vnets can be interconnected using Peering.
Subnets can also be easily created within Azure.</p>

<p>Different conffigurations are possible with VMs able to attach 2+ Network adaptors. Bridging on a gateway VM was attempted but not completed.</p>
