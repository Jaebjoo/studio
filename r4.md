# SPRINT 4 : Reflection
# "Workload Overload"

[NEXT](r5.html){: .btn}

##### What did I do well? 
### N/A
There was a lack of leadership during this sprint. And lacking direction and a rallying point, the team was in disarray and unmanaged. The team had also failed to communicate with the client also, and did not conduct any client meetings during this sprint.

There was an overwhelming workload with other commitments in various different courses. Though this was the reality, upon reflection, it is still inexcusable and also completely not AGILE that we failed to communicate with the client. However this would be a failure that our team would not repeat.

##### What could I have done better? 
### IDENTIFICATION OF OTHER DUTIES and COMMITMENTS
We did not minimise the risk of overloading our schedule with commitments. We should have been able to forsee other various deadlines that were looming. We need to find a way to be more resilient as a team and identify an overload of work before it happens.

Overall, it was a failure of **AGILE Principle 4** which states that "Business people and developers must work together **daily throughout** the project."

We could not allocate sufficient time throughout the week to continuously develop the project.

##### What lessons did I learn? 
### STORY POINTS + TEAM PAIRING
3 Different sub groups were created in an ambitious attempt to speed up velocity and also develop 3 different features simultaneously.
As mentioned in Agile Principles section, many lessons were learnt during the reflection after this absence.
Once we recognised the limitations of time, we should have notified the client and reduced the scope of the sprint so that continuous deployment could occur even if the ONE feature could be completed.

##### What barriers did I encounter? 
### TIME CONSTRAINTS
There was major time constraints as all members were occupied with other commitments and duties. I presume that there was a lot of guilt that was unspoken of, and we could not bring ourselves to call a meeting or intiate a session as we ourselves individually did not have time. We could not ask another member to "take one for the team" when we ourselves were not willing to.
