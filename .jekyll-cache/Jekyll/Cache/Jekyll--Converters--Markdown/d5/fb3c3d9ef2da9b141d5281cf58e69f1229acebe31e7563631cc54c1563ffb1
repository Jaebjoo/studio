<p>Desktop Maintenance of physical machines in in D312 must be carried out weekly on a roster.</p>

<p>I carried out the maintenance with Jonathon on August 28th.
Fully functionality of the machines must be checked and recorded.
Any faults with the machines must be investigated and reported.
Faults components must be replaced and followed up.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>4 Machines in total were fixed, Motherboards replaced and also a CPU replaced.
1 Machine needed a network card to be updated.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It was a valuable experience a small aspect of Robâ€™s job.</li>
  <li>I was able to appreciate the use of valuable time on a relatively mundane task of fixing computers.</li>
  <li>Physically repairing and troubleshooting faults with devices was time consuming and recording the results of the check was crucial</li>
  <li>I feel that the documentation process could be updated. It was currently being recorded on a single word file. Each week was recorded on a different document and it was difficult to track which computers have had a long term unfixed fault.</li>
  <li>I believe I can improve this in the next semester.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="procedures">Procedures</h4>

<p>On the 28th and 29th of August, Jonathon and I checked and fixed computers in D312.</p>
