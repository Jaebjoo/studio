**Azure DevOps** is a separate platform from the Azure Cloud Services which allow teams to coordinate and manage projects. Working AGILE while developing projects on the AZURE infrastructure is easier.

**There is no need to integrate platforms outside Microsoft products**

**Azure Cloud Services + Azure DevOps + Microsoft Teams + Microsoft Office**

These services can all be used in coordination to increase the productivity of an organisation.

I personally found Azure DevOps Boards very convenient to use. 
As GitHub is now a subsidiary of Microsoft, it felt familiar.
Azure Pipelines, testplans, repos and artifacts can support the entire development process. 

**Monitoring, testing, bug fixing, and continuous integration/delivery workflow would be seamless.**

I would recommend the use of Azure DevOps by all Studio Teams that are collaborating and managing a project. 

**DevOps** requires practices which include the following:
