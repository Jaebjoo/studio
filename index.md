# BIT DEV OPS

## Welcome

This is a summary of my work in the Studio Dev Ops Team.

The Dev Ops team operates on the Microsoft Azure Platform.
Our main task for 2020/2021 has been migrating the Otago Polytechnic IT Faculty On-site Infrastructure to the Azure Cloud Platform.

I have been personally involved with migrating the DB2/3 Resources.

Other tasks include offering dev ops assistance/solutions to other faculty members and students.

Remaining time is allocated to research of the Azure Services and Documentation.

Please use the **Navbar** above to navigate individual pages.

### Thank you!

Dev Ops Studio Team have given me valuable experience with the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform.

I hope to further progress in the field of Dev Ops with Azure Certifications and Security, IoT Expertise.
