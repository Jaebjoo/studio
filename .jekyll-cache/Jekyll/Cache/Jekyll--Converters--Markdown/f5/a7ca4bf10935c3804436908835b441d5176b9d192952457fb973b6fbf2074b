<p>It is apparent now that self-directed research is key in the industry.
I have been mislead by my own naivety that professionals in this field know everything there is. I saw that Rob, the IT manager at BIT researching and searching for solutions in parallel to our own research into DB on Azure.</p>

<p>Research is an integral part of being an IT Expert, the need for this is clearer than ever and I am more motivated to learn. I realise that there is much more that I do not know with a bachelors degree but also know that 2 years at BIT has given me the foundation to leap into the wider field of IT knowledge.</p>

<p>Research into the Database solutions, Iaas and DBaas/PaaS options was a great experience. This allowed me to utilise actual knowledge to a real life problem.</p>

<p>Research was conducted, information gathered was compiled accordingly to provide a clear and concise picture for the client to make a recommendation. I will improve these professional skills so that I am a competant employee in these areas in the field of Dev Ops.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>

<p>Not enough time was spent on learning actual skills, but I have learnt how to do many different tasks on the Azure platform. Now I am very confident with networking, creating VMs, connecting them, adding security configurations, Setting up a IoT Hub, starting a DBaaS, Setting up a MariaDB VM.</p>

<p>I have learnt how to do all these things on my own. It is surprising how much I can learn through the Azure documentation and tutorials. I will be continuing with this process in 2021.</p>
